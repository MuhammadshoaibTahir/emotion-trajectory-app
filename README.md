Use Case

“The Emotion Trajectory App is particularly useful for restaurant owners and service managers, as it enables them to systematically analyze customer feedback and identify emotional patterns linked to service quality. By visualizing how emotions evolve across user reviews, restaurant stakeholders can detect recurring sources of customer dissatisfaction such as delayed delivery, incorrect orders, or poor communication. These insights support data-driven decision-making and allow restaurants to improve operational processes, customer service strategies, and overall user satisfaction based on real customer feedback rather than isolated complaints.”
